Introduction  (one page) 
 
This etext was originally created in 1964-1965 according to Dr. 
Joseph Raben of Queens College, NY, to whom it is attributed by 
Project Gutenberg.  We had heard of this etext for years but it 
was not until 1991 that we actually managed to track it down to 
a specific location, and then it took months to convince people 
to let us have a copy, then more months for them actually to do 
the copying and get it to us.  Then another month to convert to 
something we could massage with our favorite 486 in DOS.  After 
that is was only a matter of days to get it into this shape you 
will see below.  The original was, of course, in CAPS only, and 
so were all the other etexts of the 60's and early 70's.  Don't
